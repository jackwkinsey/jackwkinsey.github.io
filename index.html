                        My name is Jack Kinsey (if you haven't already guessed that), and I am a programmer, developer, and designer. I mostly work on web and game related projects, which you can learn more about <a href="portfolio.html">here</a>. Also, if you just want to jump to my resume, you can do so <a href="resume.html">here</a>, but stick around and play some of my games or check out my blog. I'm sure I've written about something you'd enjoy.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Anyway, this is the "about" section of this website so if you are still reading this, then I can only assume that you'd like to know a little more about me. Very well. As I mentioned, I am a programmer, which means I love to solve problems. I am a developer, which means I love searching for the best solutions to said problems. And I am a designer, which means I like for those solutions to look pretty.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        When I'm not saving the world by making responsive, simple websites, or fun games for the web, I am usually playing bass and synth for my band, Kinetic (check us out <a href="http://www.kineticmusiconline.com">here</a>), or catching up on <em>Game of Thrones</em> and <em>Game Grumps</em>. I also enjoy learning about and tasting (but mostly tasting) all different kinds of beer. Currently, my favorite is <em>Boulevard</em>'s Rye-on-Rye, and I cannot recommend it enough.
                    </p>

                        Although I spend most of my time working on various projects, I am still a gamer at heart. My favorite genre of game is the action RPG. (It used to be just RPGs, but I've grown impatient in recent years and now I need lots of action-y goodness. Don't worry I still love a good story.) Currently, I am dying my way through <em>Dark Souls</em> (the first one) and am having a blast doing so. Although I am currently stuck on the Four Kings boss. Yes, I know I need to use Havel's armor and just "swing away," but I just suck, okay?!
                    </p>

                        Well, that is pretty much it for me. If you have any questions, feel free to ask!
