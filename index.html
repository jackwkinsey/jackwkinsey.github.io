                        My name is Jack Kinsey (if you haven't already guessed 
                        that), and I am a programmer, developer, and designer. 
                        I mostly work on web and game related projects, which 
                        you can learn more about <a href="portfolio.html">here</a>. 
                        Or, if you are looking for my resume, you can get it from
                        my Dropbox, <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/s/kc0gvand1hxblk1/JackKinsey-Resume.pdf?dl=0">here</a>.
                        <br><br>
                        Anyway, this is the "about" section of this website so 
                        if you are still reading this, then I can only assume 
                        that you'd like to know a little more about me. Very 
                        well. As I mentioned, I am a programmer, which means I 
                        love to solve problems. I am a developer, which means I 
                        love searching for the best solutions to those problems. 
                        And I am a designer, which means I like for those 
                        solutions to look pretty.
                        <br><br>
                        Currently, I work for Microsoft as a Service Advisor,
                        and work on small, side projects in my spare time. If
                        you would like to contact me, you can find me on Twitter
                        (<a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?screen_name=jackwkinsey">@jackwkinsey</a>),
                        or visit my <a href="contact.html">contact</a> page for
